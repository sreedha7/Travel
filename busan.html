                #1 – Haeundae Beach – One of the most incredible free places to go in Busan
            </h1><br><br>

            <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0505b9_54b039db12a1407ea67e5f95953b1269~mv2.jpg/v1/crop/x_0,y_0,w_1324,h_838/fill/w_640,h_500,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/Haeundae%20Beach%20G.jpg"
                height="200px" id="super">

            <ul>
                <li>-- Considered one of the most beautiful beaches in all of South Korea</li>
                <li>-- Don’t miss watching a sunset from here – they’re amazing!</li>
                <li>-- One of the most popular hotspots in Busan</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Why it’s awesome:</b> One of the most popular hotspots in Busan for tourists, travellers, and locals
                alike,
                you will definitely want to spend some time on Haeundae Beach! It’s hard to believe that such a
                beautiful beach could be right on the edge of a city, but that’s exactly what you get here. If you’re
                backpacking, you might end up staying here as there are a number of cool hostels in this area. There are
                also plenty of international restaurants if you haven’t plucked up the courage to try proper Korean food
                yet! Backpackers in South Korea love the food and you will too.<br><br>
                <b>What to do there:</b> It’s impossible to be bored on Haeundae Beach. Of course, you have the regular
                stuff
                like sunbathing and swimming, but there’s way more to this stretch of sand than that. During the day,
                you’ll find art exhibits and music events, while it really comes alive at night. Some of the city’s best
                nightlife is along the streets by Haeundae Beach so you’ll want to come here for a night out!
                Incredibly, you can see the coast of Japan from this beach on a clear day.

                <li>-- A formerly run-down neighbourhood, revived by community artists</li>
                <li>-- One of the coolest points of interest in Busan</li>

            </ul>
            </ul>


            <p><b>Why it’s awesome:</b> Sometimes referred to as Korea’s Santorini, Gamcheon Culture Village is where
                you’ll
                want to go to get an alternative perspective on this Asian country. It’s hard to say it’s a traditional
                and authentic side of South Korea, but it’s certainly a cool one. Admire the old-style Korean
                architecture which has been restored and decorated by local artists. This colourful area is chock-full
                of places to duck into if the weather gets too hot and you need a break. Definitely one of the best
                places in Busan to spend a day!<br><br>

                <b>What to do there:</b> Bring a pair of comfortable shoes as you’re going to spend a lot of time
                wandering the
                alleyways of Gamcheon Cultural Village. There are tons of surprises throughout the streets, and you’re
                likely to come across a cute café or a tiny art gallery. It’s also a great place to pick up souvenirs
                for friends and family back home! Make sure you bring a camera, or at least your phone. The colourful
                houses, which look like they’ve just been dropped on the hillside, make for some great Insta shots!

                You could also stay in a sick Busan airbnb around here too, how cool would that be?

                #3 – Haedong Yonggung Temple – One of the best religious places to see in Busan
            </h1><br><br>
            <img src="https://www.wheregoesrose.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Haedong-Yonggung.jpg" height="200px"
                id="super">

            <ul>
                <li>-- Considered one of the most beautiful temples in the whole of South Korea</li>
                <li>-- Easy to get to from the city centre</li>
                <li>-- One of the few temples in South Korea that overlooks the ocean</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b> Why it’s awesome:</b> Dating back to the 14th century, Haedong Yonggung Temple is worth visiting as
                much
                for is history as it is for its serene and sublime location. It was built by Naong, a Buddhist
                teacher during the Goryeo Dynasty. Most temples in Korea are either in cities or up in the
                mountains. It’s very rare that you’ll get one so near the ocean, so that is a reason to visit in
                itself! This is without a doubt one of the most recognisable landmarks in Busan.<br><br>

                <b>What to do there:</b> The good news is its really easy to get to from the centre of Busan, and even
                more
                so from Haeundae Beach. So, if you’ve maxed out your sunbathing and swimming time, make this your
                next stop. During Buddha month, this is an incredible place to be, especially at night, as the
                temple is adorned with many lanterns. If you find the walk to the temple tricky, you can always stop
                for food on the way. Lining the steps up to the temple there are lots of street food kiosks selling
                street food, so you’ll have no trouble keeping your energy up!

                #4 – Jangsan Mountain – A beautiful and scenic place to check out in Busan
            </h1><br><br>

            <img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/36/df/f2/pokposa-fall.jpg?w=1200&h=-1&s=1"

                <li>-- How to see Busan from the surrounding mountains</li>
                <li>-- A moderate to difficult hiking trail</li>
                <li>-- Especially beautiful in October and November</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Why it’s awesome:</b>Sometimes you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and really
                get
                some fresh air. Going hiking is a great way to do that, and in a city surrounded by mountains, it
                would be rude not to! There are a number of cool hiking spots, but one of our favourites is Jangsan
                Mountain. The mountain is split into lots of hiking trails suitable for different levels of fitness
                and experience. It takes about 2 hours to get to the top of the 634-metre high mountain!<br>

                <b>What to do there:</b> If you ask the locals what they like to do on a weekend, a fair few would
                recommend Jangsan Mountain! If you don’t feel confident in getting to the top of the mountain, then
                select one of the routes that will take you halfway up. It’ll still give you stunning views of the
                city. The mountain is dotted with silver grass fields, which sparkle in the sun. This effect is most
                noticeable and prettiest during October and November. So, don’t miss one of the best places in Busan
                for hiking if you’re visiting during those months!

                #5 – Busan Tower and Yongdusan Park
            </h1><br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>-- 120-metre tower with city views</li>
                <li>-- Park packed with attractions – one of the best places in Busan for a day out</li>
                <li>-- One of the major landmarks in Busan</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Why it’s awesome:</b> If you liked the sound of the city views from our best luxury hotel in Busan but
                your budget doesn’t stretch to staying at the Park Hyatt, we’ve got an alternative for you. Yongdusan
                Park houses one of the tallest attractions in Busan, the 120-metre tower. From here you’ll get great
                views of the city, as Yongdusan Park is actually pretty high up. Yes, Yongdusan translates as ‘dragon’s
                head mountain!’<br>

            <b>What to do there:</b> After you’ve taken in fantastic views of the city and snapped a few pictures, there’s
                plenty more to do on ground level in the park. See the traditional Korean Bell housed in a building at
                the foot of the tower. Then, head to the Museum of World Folk Instruments to see beautifully preserved
                examples of instruments. If those aren’t quite enough, be sure to check out the Flower Clock, the Bronze
                Dragon Statue, and the Locks of Love!
